                        methodologies and so on and so on – anything  Java.</p>

                    <h1>Upcoming Meetings</h1>
                    <h2>4th July 2012
                    <p>Planning meeting/social - discussing what people want from Brighton Java and ideas for future sessions. This event will be run by David Pashley and takes 
                        place at the Eagle Pub.</p>
                    <h2>1st August 2012</h2>
                    <p><strong>Debate: Is Server-Side Java Dead?</strong>
                    <p>Java is an established server technology but how does it compare to more recent, sexier frameworks and technologies? Is Java suited for cutting-edge 
                        development on the modern web? We've asked some speakers from the local development community to speaking proposing and opposing the motion. Does Java 
                        hold its own, or is it time to move over to more seductive new technologies?</p>
                    <h2>Future Events</h2>
                    <p>Some of the future events we're planning include:</p>
