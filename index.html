                    Brighton Java is a group bringing together Java users, enthusiasts and learners. Our monthly meetings will include talks, workshops and socials. 
                    We’re mostly based at the Skiff in Gloucester St and meet on the first Wednesday of the month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re interested in the whole world of Java – android development, server frameworks, Groovy, interesting tools, applications, Clojure, development 
                    methodologies and so on and so on – anything  Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have any ideas for future sessions please 
                    <a href="mailto:contact@brightonjava.com">get in touch</a>.

                <h2>Forthcoming Meetings</h1>
                    <h3>Wednesday 3rd April 2013, 7:00pm: Talks evening</h3>
<p>Brighton Java is back after its Winter hibernation. Our next event will be a talks evening, with James Grant from <a href="http://www.brandwatch.com/">Brandwatch</a> talking about <em>Map Reduce: An Example for Java Developers</em>.</p>
<p>We'll be open from 7 for everyone to meet, with the talk at  around 7:30. During the first part of the evening we will collect topics and questions - these will be voted on and the most popular discussed in a round-table during the second half.</p>
<p>Beer and pizza will be supplied by the folk at <a href="http://www.ansr.io/">ansr.io</a> - please RSVP so we can be sure to have enough!</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk">Nick Doyle</a>: <em>The Cost of Continuous Integration and Delivery</em><br/>
                       Most developers are familiar with the terms continuous integration and continuous delivery. We automate test builds using tools such as Jenkins to 
                       identify problems relating to new code as early as possible.</p>

                    <p>But for modern web applications, it comes at a price. As the number of automated tests – particularly browser-based tests – gets into the thousands, the 
                        feedback loop slows right down. This can in turn lead to developer apathy and a loss of interest in their responsibility to maintain a stable build. 
                        Worse still, delivery is put at risk because it's harder to tell whether you have a build which is deployable.</p>

                    <p>How we can keep the feedback loop as fast as possible, without necessarily doing the obvious: throwing lots of money at it and breaking the bank in 
                        hardware costs?</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="http://www.tomhume.org">Tom Hume</a>: <em>Hunting for truly optimal code</em><br/>
                       Computer scientists use the term "optimisation" to refer to improving code, rather than achieving true optimality. In 1989 Henry Massalin proposed the
                       superoptimiser, a program which would perform an exhaustive search for the shortest possible program which calculates a given function.</p> 

                    <p>Massalin and others have built superoptimisers for specific hardware architectures . For my MSc dissertation I've spent the last few months seeing
                       if superoptimisation is useful for virtual machines - specifically, the JVM. I'll go into a bit more history, outline what I've done, and talk about what 
                       I've discovered.</p>
                       
                    <p><a href="http://www.orbific.com/weblog">James Burt</a>: <em>The Wonderful World of Software Maintenance!</em><br/>
                       Why is one of the most important aspects of software one of the least discussed? Maintenance is one of the most common tasks for developers but people 
                       prefer to talk about exciting new technologies or tell war stories about death marches and feats of extreme coding. It’s time that software maintenance 
                       got the appreciation it deserved as a challenging, rewarding and fulfilling role for programmers. We’ll look at what software maintenance involves, why 
                       heroes are bad, and some guidelines for handling software as it enters middle age.</p>   

                    <p>
                        Java is an established server technology but how does it compare to more recent, sexier frameworks and technologies? Is Java suited for cutting-edge 
                        development on the modern web? We've asked some speakers from the local development community to speak, propose and oppose the motion. Does Java 
                        hold its own, or is it time to move over to more seductive new technologies?  -->

                        you would like to present something (about 10-15 minutes), please <a href="mailto:contact@brightonjava.com">email us</a>                     </p>
