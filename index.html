                    Brighton Java is a group bringing together Java users, enthusiasts and learners. Our monthly meetings will include talks, workshops and socials. 
                    We’re mostly based at the Skiff in Gloucester St and meet on the first Wednesday of the month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re interested in the whole world of Java – android development, server frameworks, Groovy, interesting tools, applications, Clojure, development 
                    methodologies and so on and so on – anything  Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have any ideas for future sessions please 
                    <a href="mailto:contact@brightonjava.com">get in touch</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Forthcoming Meetings</h1>
                    <h3>Wednesday 7th November 2012, 7:30pm: What do you use?</h3>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Subversion or git? Idea, netbeans or eclipse? Ant or maven? Jenkins or Hudson? Struts or spring? The world of Java development offers a wide range of tools and working out which
                    one to use can be a nightmare. Brighton Java's November session will be a structured discussion of Java tools. Which do you use? Which do you hate? What do other people recommend?
                 </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    The evening will feature a short presentation on Heroku by David Pashley. Refreshments will be
                    provided - please sign-up on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Java/events/88200702/">the Meetup page</a>
                    so that we have an idea of numbers.
                    </p>
                       
                    <p><a href="http://www.codingcraft.co.uk">David Pashley</a>: <em>Heroku and You</em><br/>
                    Heroku is a cloud provider with a difference. You don't need a sysadmin to manange your services. All you need to do is to git push your code to their service and they take care of
                    the rest. In this talk David will demonstrate how to set up a standard Spring project to run on Heroku in five minutes.
                       </p>   


                       <p>If you'd like to give a short 10-15 minute demonstration on a tool that makes your development easier, please get in touch.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>An evening of talks featuring <a href="http://www.tomhume.org">Tom Hume</a> talking about super-optimisers, 
                        <a href="http://www.orbific.com/weblog">James Burt</a> on software maintenance and Nick Doyle from <a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk">Crunch</a> speaking
                        on Continuous Integration. Drinks will be provided</strong>.<br/>There is no need to book but if you <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Java/events/77826922/">register for the event on meetup</a> it helps us plan for numbers.

                    <p><a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk">Nick Doyle</a>: <em>The Cost of Continuous Integration and Delivery</em><br/>
                       Most developers are familiar with the terms continuous integration and continuous delivery. We automate test builds using tools such as Jenkins to 
                       identify problems relating to new code as early as possible.</p>

                    <p>But for modern web applications, it comes at a price. As the number of automated tests – particularly browser-based tests – gets into the thousands, the 
                        feedback loop slows right down. This can in turn lead to developer apathy and a loss of interest in their responsibility to maintain a stable build. 
                        Worse still, delivery is put at risk because it's harder to tell whether you have a build which is deployable.</p>

                    <p>How we can keep the feedback loop as fast as possible, without necessarily doing the obvious: throwing lots of money at it and breaking the bank in 
                        hardware costs?</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="http://www.tomhume.org">Tom Hume</a>: <em>Hunting for truly optimal code</em><br/>
                       Computer scientists use the term "optimisation" to refer to improving code, rather than achieving true optimality. In 1989 Henry Massalin proposed the
                       superoptimiser, a program which would perform an exhaustive search for the shortest possible program which calculates a given function.</p> 

                    <p>Massalin and others have built superoptimisers for specific hardware architectures . For my MSc dissertation I've spent the last few months seeing
                       if superoptimisation is useful for virtual machines - specifically, the JVM. I'll go into a bit more history, outline what I've done, and talk about what 
                       I've discovered.</p>
                       
                    <p><a href="http://www.orbific.com/weblog">James Burt</a>: <em>The Wonderful World of Software Maintenance!</em><br/>
                       Why is one of the most important aspects of software one of the least discussed? Maintenance is one of the most common tasks for developers but people 
                       prefer to talk about exciting new technologies or tell war stories about death marches and feats of extreme coding. It’s time that software maintenance 
                       got the appreciation it deserved as a challenging, rewarding and fulfilling role for programmers. We’ll look at what software maintenance involves, why 
                       heroes are bad, and some guidelines for handling software as it enters middle age.</p>   

                    <p>
<!--                        Java is an established server technology but how does it compare to more recent, sexier frameworks and technologies? Is Java suited for cutting-edge 
                        development on the modern web? We've asked some speakers from the local development community to speak, propose and oppose the motion. Does Java 
                        hold its own, or is it time to move over to more seductive new technologies?  -->
                        <!-- "We have some exciting talks lined up - full details will be released soon. We may also have a slot spare for a short 10-15 minute talk, so if 
                        you would like to present something (about 10-15 minutes), please <a href="mailto:contact@brightonjava.com">email us</a> -->
